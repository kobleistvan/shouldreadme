# ShouldReadMe
## 2014 Koding Global Virtual Hackaton submission
[![Koding Hackathon](/img/badge.png?raw=true "Koding Hackathon")](https://koding.com/Hackathon)
============
## Intro
#### DO YOU EVER READ TERMS & CONDITIONS?
###### Over 90% of the people don`t, because legal documents are boring, way too long and difficult to understand, so how about start using a creative and interactive alternative?

## Description

> - ShouldReadMe is supposedly a web application aiming to address one of the hackathon themes, more precisely aiming to solve the issue regarding the fact that nobody ready fine papers (EULA, T&C etc) anymore, yet every website has them. 
> - Obviously, they are written in a not so natural manner, hard to understand, boring and some, extremely long. 
It would be nice if they could make a small summary for average Joe, right?
> - Pictures might just be the answer! Well, that's just not enough... Visit the website (may be down after hackathon will end) and check out some future features, like embedding the final shouldreadme content into a website, generating FAQs, microquizzes with offers, and more! (Obviously, it's not yet fully functional, because of the lack of sufficient time to finalize the project)

> **Who we are and what do we want?**

> - We're a few humble developers from Cluj-Napoca, Romania, situated in Transylvania, the fearsome land of vampires!
> - Being perl developers, we're considered to be members of the **Perl Counts of Transylvania** - [ClujPM]
> - We're excited about the first worldwide online hackathon and would like to be a part of it, take the challenge of competing with other talented developers from all around the world.

> **What technologies do we like?**
######We're interested in a vast array of different technologies and in the way we combine them for a higher goal. Some of our favorite technologies being:
> - Perl frameworks and modules (Dancer, Catalyst, Mojolicious, DBIx::Class etc.)
> - Javascript frameworks (Backbone)
> - HTML5  & CSS3
> - Various APIs
> - Anything old school, new and experimental!

####Good luck to everyone!
